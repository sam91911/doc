\df{Signal}<br>
$x$ is a Signal $\iff x \in A^B$ where $A, B$ is sets, or it can be represented by $x$ is a function, $f:B \to A$.<br>
\anno{the elements of $A^B$ is functions $f:B \to A$}.<br>
\df{System}<br>
$x$ is a System $\iff x \in \sd{A^B}^\sd{A^B}$ where $A, B$ is sets.<br>
\df{continuous time signal}<br>
$x$ is continuous time signal $\iff x \in A^R$ where $A$ is a set.<br>
\df{discrete time signal}<br>
$x$ is discrete time signal $\iff x \in A^Z$ where $A$ is a set.<br>
At this scope, the codomain is typically $R$, e.g., a continuous time signal is a element in $R^R$.<br>
\oper{addition}{signal}<br>
\prer{the domain $A$ and codomain $B$ of the two signals, $f,g$, is the same, and $B$ has addition operation.}<br>
The addition of the two signals is $f+g$ generated by the equation $\sd{\forall x \in A}\md{\sd{f+g}\sd{x} = f\sd{x} + g\sd{x}}$.<br>
\oper{scaling}{signal}<br>
\prer{the codomain $B$ of the signal $f$ has scaling operation with scaling factor in the sets $C$.}<br>
The scaling of the signal $f$ with factor $a$ is $af$ generated by the equation $\sd{\forall x \in A}\md{\sd{af}\sd{x} = a\sd{f\sd{x}}}$ where $A$ is the domain of $f$.<br>
\oper{addition}{system}<br>
\prer{the domain and codomain $A$ of the two systems, $f,g$, is the same, and $A$ has addition operation.}<br>
The addtition of the two systems is $f+g$ generated by the equation $\sd{\forall x \in A}\md{\sd{f+g}\sd{x} = f\sd{x} + g\sd{x}}$.<br>
\oper{scaling}{system}<br>
\prer{the domain and codomain $A$ of the system $f$ has scaling operation with scaling factor in the sets $B$.}<br>
The scaling of the system $f$ with factor $a$ is $af$ generated by the equation $\sd{\forall x \in A}\md{\sd{af}\sd{x} = a\sd{f\sd{x}}}$.<br>
\prop{stability}{system}<br>
\prer{$A$ is the domain and codomain of the system $f$. The codomain $B$ of $A$ is measurable to $R$.}<br>
$f$ is stable $\iff \sd{\forall x \in A}\md{\sd{\forall y \in B}\md{\abs{x\sd{y}} < \infty} \to \sd{\forall y \in B}\md{\abs{f\sd{x\sd{y}}} < \infty}}$.<br>
\anno{$\abs{x}$ is the measurement of $x$}<br>
