*def.* **Signal**<br>
$x$ is a Signal $\iff x \in A^B$ where $A, B$ is sets, or it can be represented by $x$ is a function, $f:B \to A$.<br>
*anno.* *the elements of $A^B$ is functions $f:B \to A$.*<br>
*def.* **System**<br>
$x$ is a System $\iff x \in \left(A^B\right)^\left(A^B\right)$ where $A, B$ is sets.<br>
*def.* **continuous time signal**<br>
$x$ is continuous time signal $\iff x \in A^R$ where $A$ is a set.<br>
*def.* **discrete time signal** <br>
$x$ is discrete time signal $\iff x \in A^Z$ where $A$ is a set.<br>
At this scope, the codomain is typically $R$, e.g., a continuous time signal is a element in $R^R$.<br>
*oper.* **addition** of **signal**<br>
*prer.*the domain $A$ and codomain $B$ of the two signals, $f,g$, is the same, and $B$ has addition operation.<br>
The addition of the two signals is $f+g$ generated by the equation $\left(\forall x \in A\right)\left[\left(f+g\right)\left(x\right) = f\left(x\right) + g\left(x\right)\right]$.<br>
*oper.* **scaling** of **signal**<br>
*prer.*the codomain $B$ of the signal $f$ has scaling operation with scaling factor in the sets $C$.<br>
The scaling of the signal $f$ with factor $a$ is $af$ generated by the equation $\left(\forall x \in A\right)\left[\left(af\right)\left(x\right) = a\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right]$ where $A$ is the domain of $f$.<br>
*oper.* **addition** of **system**<br>
*prer.*the domain codomain $A$ of the two systems, $f,g$, is the same, and $A$ has addition operation.<br>
The addition of the two systems is $f+g$ generated by the equation $\left(\forall x \in A\right)\left[\left(f+g\right)\left(x\right) = f\left(x\right) + g\left(x\right)\right]$.<br>
*oper.* **scaling** of **system**<br>
*prer.*the domain and codomain $A$ of the system $f$ has scaling operation with scaling factor in the sets $B$.<br>
The scaling of the system $f$ with factor $a$ is $af$ generated by the equation $\left(\forall x \in A\right)\left[\left(af\right)\left(x\right) = a\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right]$.<br>
*prop.* **stability** of **system**<br>
*prer.*$A$ is the domain and codomain of the system $f$. The codomain $B$ of $A$ is measurable to $R$.<br>
$f$ is stable $\iff \left(\forall x \in A\right)\left[\left(\forall y \in B\right)\left[\left|x\left(y\right)\right| < \infty\right] \to \left(\forall y \in B\right)\left[\left|f\left(x\left(y\right)\right)\right| < \infty\right]\right]$.<br>
*anno.* *$\left|x\right|$ is the measurement of $x$*<br>
